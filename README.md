**ContainerCruise: Containerized Application Deployment on Cloud with CI/CD**

![aws_archietecture](https://github.com/Harshvardhansinh-jadeja/ContainerCruise/assets/63868398/fabdfe7f-46b5-48a5-85b0-f8113d719083)


**Project Overview**

ContainerCruise is a project that streamlines containerized application deployment on the cloud using a robust CI/CD pipeline. It leverages GitHub Actions for pipeline orchestration, AWS as the cloud provider, and a comprehensive suite of services for infrastructure management, deployment, and monitoring.

**Key Technologies**

**GitHub Actions:** Automated workflows triggered by code commits or other events.

**AWS** (Amazon Web Services):

**VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated network segment to host your application's resources.

**ALB** (Application Load Balancer): Distributes incoming traffic across your application instances.

**ECR** (Elastic Container Registry): Securely stores and manages container images.

**ECS**(Elastic Container Service) with Fargate: Manages container orchestration and provides compute resources.

**CloudWatch**: Monitors application and infrastructure performance.

**SNS**(Simple Notification Service): Delivers event notifications.

**RDS** (Relational Database Service): Provides a managed database service.

**Internet Gateway:** Enables communication between your VPC and the internet.

**NAT Gateway**: Allows outbound internet traffic from your VPC.

**Subnet Group**: A collection of subnets within a VPC.

**Security Group**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic for your resources.

**Target Group:** A collection of healthy instances that the ALB routes traffic to.

**Elastic IP**: Provides a static IP address for your resources.

**Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for managing and provisioning AWS resources.


**Benifits**

**Automated Deployments:** Reduce manual intervention and errors through CI/CD.

**Scalability**: Easily scale your application up or down based on demand.

**High Availability:** Ensure application uptime with load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Security**: Leverage AWS security features and best practices for a secure environment.

**Monitoring**: Gain insights into application and infrastructure performance with CloudWatch.

**Infrastructure Management**: Manage your infrastructure declaratively using Terraform.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**

An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
A GitHub project.
Basic familiarity with AWS, CI/CD concepts, and Terraform.
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshvardhansinh-jadeja/ContainerCruise.git
Use code with caution.
Configure AWS Credentials:

Create a .aws folder in your project's root directory.
Within .aws, create a file named credentials with your AWS access key ID and secret access key in the appropriate format:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <your_access_key_id>
aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_access_key>
Configure Terraform:

Set environment variables or update terraform.tfvars according to your AWS environment.


Initialize Terraform:
Bash

cd ContainerCruise

terraform init

Use code with caution.

Build and Deploy:

Run the GitHub Actions workflow to build your container image, provision infrastructure on AWS, and deploy your application. The specific workflow name might vary depending on your setup.
Additional Considerations

**Security:**

Implement IAM roles for least privilege access.

Secure your container images with appropriate permissions.

Configure security groups to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.

**Monitoring:**

Set up CloudWatch alarms for key metrics to receive notifications.

Integrate with your preferred monitoring platform for centralized visibility.

**CI/CD Pipeline Customization**
:
Tailor the GitHub Actions workflow to your specific application build and deployment processes.
